        <h2>Why we started Greenly</h2>
        <p>Greenly was formed with the idea of helping people take a break from their busy urban lives and breathe some peace. When Anubhav Shah (BCA) after completing his degree, he saw the separation between people and nature and decided to start Greenly to build a bridge between the two.<br><br>

            Rooted firmly in his family’s century old agri-tech business, Greenly sprung up like a new leaf on a spring morning and is today a mighty tree that helps other smaller businesses thrive in its shade. We have formed a proudly Made in India ecosystem that grows with each passing day.</p>
